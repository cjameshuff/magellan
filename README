Requirements:
zlib
libpng
Lua

Currently, some needed libraries are built and linked statically when building on Mac OS X. These need to be downloaded:
wget http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.5.tar.gz
wget http://download.sourceforge.net/libpng/libpng-1.4.5.tar.gz
wget http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.1.4.tar.gz
make libs

Then:
make
make install

By default, installs binaries in ~/bin and puts some data files and scripts into a "magellan" directory in the Minecraft directory, the exact location depending on platform.

nbtutil is a Lua script interpreter with functionality added for loading and writing NBT files. magellan has the same interpreter and bindings, but also has a map loader and renderer. nbtutil is a bit superfluous at this point, but may be extended in the future with functionality that distinguishes it from magellan.

Usage is similar for both. The first argument is the command/script to perform, later arguments depend on it. It is first interpreted as a path, and if a file exists at that location it is executed as a Lua script. If no file exists, the magellan scripts directory is searched next. If there's still no match, a .lua extension is added and the scripts directory is searched again.
